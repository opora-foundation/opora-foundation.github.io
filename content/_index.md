# Who we are

OPORA Foundation (formerly known as Displaced People Unit) is a collective of high-skilled professionals who are business/social consultants, academics and tech experts. 
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

Our mission is to offer evidence-based policy, grounded research and operational/managing solutions for displaced people in cooperation with relevant actors. Being a diverse team of Ukrainian expats, and Dutch and international professionals, we have become the bridge between displaced communities and the Dutch governmental/non-governmental institutions.
