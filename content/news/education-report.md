There are up to 30 000 Ukrainian children in the Netherlands.

Yet, are we aware of how they experience the education process in the new country? Are their parents involved in the educational process? Do they socialize with Dutch children? How do parents evaluate the psychological state of their children?

The answers to these questions are provided in the extensive research report published by OPORA Foundation on the State of Education for Displaced Ukrainian children in the Netherlands. The report is based on the study conducted in June-August 2022 by the OPORA research team Maria Shaidrova, Anastasiia Omelianiuk, Minh Ngo, Juliette Bonnepart, Jet Reefman.
