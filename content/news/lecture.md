The first Monday of the fall, we filled with a trip to the Hague to give a lecture, ‘Displaced Ukrainians in NL: background, trends, problems, and solutions' at the Ministry of Social Affairs and Employment.

Although we have been working with Dutch institutions by doing research and consulting for displaced Ukrainians in the Netherlands for five months, this lecture is the first given as official representatives of the OPORA foundation.
